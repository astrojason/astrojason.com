Source code for [http://www.astrojason.com](http://www.astrojason.com/)., built using the Laravel 4 framework, Angular JS and Bootstrap 3.

Work in Progress
----------------
Things probably won't work. This is something I do in my free time and use as a learning experience. The code may very well go down weird paths as I try and fail to get it to do the things I want it to do.

Current plans are:

+ Add the ability to actually edit and save links
+ Add ability to move movie's up or down in my ratings list
+ Integrate link manager with Instapaper (had this working, but broke it somehow)
+ Integrate the book manager with GoodReads
+ Create the databases on heroku
+ Migrate the data from my local mySQL to heroku's PostGres
